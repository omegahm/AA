 * Problem 2 of the travelling couple for the second assignment in Advanced Algorithms 2011. 
 * The monuments are represented by points. All the edges in this graph are implicit, meaning 
 * that there are edges from any vertex to all other vertices, and the weight of the edge (i,j)
 * can be calculated using:
 * <code>points[i].distance(points[j]);</code>
